# Learn Design Patterns
(because your future sanity depends on it!)

### Setup Instructions

- Prepare a basic venv:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
- Ensure you're using the right python binary associated with the venv:
    ```bash
    which python
    ```
    (should be something like): 
    > /home/loki/Desktop/ldp/.venv/python
- Check which python version you're using:
    ```bash
    python --version
    ```
    (mine is):
    > Python 3.8.10
